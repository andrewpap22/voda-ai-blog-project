Remember for the project to work you need to create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```md
DATABASE_URL=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=''
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=''
WEBHOOK_SECRET=''
```

For the user webhook to work you need to create a webhook in your Clerk dashboard and add the secret to the `.env` file. This was needed to get user information from Clerk and store it in our database.

> I'll try to make the webhook work with the Vercel deployed url, but currently I need to serve the localhost url to the internet to make it work.

```md
ngrok http 3000 --region eu

The above command is used to serve the localhost url to the internet. You can use the url generated by ngrok to create the webhook in Clerk dashboard.

The url changes every time you create a new ngrok instance and you have to update the webhook url in Clerk dashboard.

But it usually looks like this: (along the path for the webhook user endpoint)

https://<ngrok-url>/api/webhooks/user
```

For the database to work you need to create a database in Planetscale and add the database url to the `.env` file.

For the Clerk authentication to work you need to create a Clerk project and add the publishable key and secret key to the `.env` file.

The above instructions are for the project to work locally, for the Vercel deployment everything is already set up. More info will be provided on the review call.

In general you run the project with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
